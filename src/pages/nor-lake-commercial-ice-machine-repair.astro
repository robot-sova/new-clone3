<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Nor-Lake commercial ice machines</strong> are a trusted choice for restaurants, bars, hotels, healthcare facilities, and convenience stores due to their efficiency, durability, and high-capacity ice production.

<h2>Common Issues with Nor-Lake Commercial Ice Machines</h2>
<p>Even though Nor-Lake ice machines are built for durability, they can develop operational problems over time, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low ice production</strong> â€“ Often due to water line clogs, dirty filters, or refrigerant leaks.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice machine not making ice</strong> â€“ Caused by malfunctioning water inlet valves, thermostat failures, or compressor issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Misshapen or cloudy ice cubes</strong> â€“ Usually a result of water impurities, low water pressure, or a failing evaporator plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice machine freezing up</strong> â€“ Due to blocked air filters, temperature sensor failures, or excessive mineral buildup.</li>
    <li><strong>Water leakage</strong> â€“ Caused by cracked hoses, clogged drain lines, or loose connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Excessive noise and vibration</strong> â€“ Indicating potential issues with motors, compressors, or internal components.</li>
