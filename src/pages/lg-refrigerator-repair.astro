This helps maintain a fresh and clean environment inside your refrigerator.</p></li><li><p><strong>Temperature Settings</strong>: Check the temperature settings to ensure they are within the recommended range (between 35°F and 38°F). Proper temperature settings help prevent food spoilage and ensure optimal performance.</p></li></ul><p>By following these simple maintenance tips, you can help prevent common issues with your LG refrigerator, such as temperature fluctuations, ice buildup, and reduced performance.
