<h1>Follet Commercial Ice Machine Repair by Technicians at Same Day Appliance Repair</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Follet commercial ice machines</strong> are known for their superior ice production, energy efficiency, and innovative technology. These machines are widely used in restaurants, bars, hotels, hospitals, corporate offices, and educational institutions due to their ability to produce high-quality chewable ice, flake ice, and nugget ice for a variety of applications.</p>

<p>Despite their durability, <strong>Follet ice machines</strong> can develop technical problems over time, leading to reduced ice production, inconsistent ice quality, and equipment failures. At <strong>Same Day Appliance Repair</strong>, we specialize in <strong>Follet commercial ice machine repair</strong>, providing <strong>same-day service across California</strong> to ensure your business never runs out of ice.</p>

<h2>Common Issues with Follet Commercial Ice Machines</h2>
<p>Even though Follet ice machines are designed for reliability, they can develop common performance issues, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low ice production</strong> â€“ Often caused by a clogged water filter, restricted water flow, or refrigerant issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow ice formation</strong> â€“ Due to dirty condenser coils, inadequate airflow, or incorrect water temperature.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice cubes are too small or misshapen</strong> â€“ Typically caused by mineral buildup, faulty evaporator plates, or inconsistent water pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Ice machine freezing up</strong> â€“ Caused by a defective thermostat, restricted airflow, or clogged evaporator coils.</li>
    <li><strong>Unusual noises or vibrations</strong> â€“ Often linked to worn-out motors, failing fans, or a malfunctioning compressor.</li>
    <li><strong>Water leaks around the unit</strong> â€“ Can be due to a cracked hose, loose fittings, or a clogged drain line.</li>
    <li><strong>Error codes displayed</strong> â€“ Indicating electrical issues, sensor failures, or temperature irregularities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these issues arise due to <strong>lack of routine maintenance</strong>. Hard water deposits, poor water quality, and dirty condenser coils can significantly reduce the efficiency of your ice machine.
