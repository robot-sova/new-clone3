      <p style="text-align: start"><strong>GE (General Electric) dryers</strong> are known for their reliability and
        durability, but like any appliance, they can face common problems over time. Some typical issues include

          malfunctions</strong> that lead to incorrect drying cycles. Other frequent issues are <strong>control board
          malfunctions</strong> and <strong>venting blockages</strong>, which can affect dryer performance and efficiency.</p>
