      <h2>Common Haier Dryer Issues and Our Repair Solutions</h2>
      <p ><strong>Haier dryers</strong> are known for their compact designs and energy efficiency,
        but like all appliances, they can encounter issues over time. Common problems include <strong>heating element
          failures</strong>, which prevent the dryer from generating enough heat, or <strong>faulty thermal fuses</strong>,
        which may stop the dryer from operating altogether. Other frequent issues include <strong>sensor
          malfunctions</strong>, <strong>venting blockages</strong>, and <strong>motor or belt failures</strong>, all of which
        can lead to inefficient drying cycles or a non-operational dryer.</p>
