      <h2 >Common JennAir Dryer Issues and Our Repair Solutions</h2>
      <p ><strong>JennAir dryers</strong> are known for their high performance and advanced features,
        but like any appliance, they can develop problems over time. Some common issues include <strong>heating element

        prevent the dryer from turning on. Other frequent issues include <strong>blower wheel malfunctions</strong> that
        hinder airflow and <strong>control panel failures</strong>, which cause the dryer to become unresponsive or display
        incorrect settings.</p>
