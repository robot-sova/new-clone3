                See prices below. While not every repair needs new parts, certain situations require replacement parts to restore your commercial oven to peak performance. Our technicians carry various parts in their vehicles, which usually enables same-day repairs. If a part must be ordered, the cost will vary depending on the repair, brand, and model of your commercial oven.

        <div class="questions">
          <p>
            To determine if your oven element is bad, you can look for several signs and perform a few tests. Here's how to check if the heating element in your oven needs replacing:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Visual Inspection: </b>First, visually inspect the element for any signs of damage such as blistering, bubbling, or cracks. A damaged element often has visible holes or black spots.</li>
            <li><b> Lack of Heat: </b>Turn on the oven and set it to bake mode. If the element does not glow red (for electric ovens) or heat up within a few minutes, this is a strong indicator that the element is not working.</li>
            <li><b>Uneven Cooking: </b>If you notice that your food is cooked unevenly, this can also be a sign that the element isn't distributing heat evenly or effectively.</li>
            <li><b>Use a Multimeter: </b>To more definitively test the element, you can use a multimeter set to the ohm setting. First, ensure the oven is unplugged and cool. Disconnect the element from the terminals, and place each of the multimeter's leads on one terminal. A properly functioning element should give a reading of 20 to 40 ohms. Significantly higher or infinite readings indicate a faulty element.</li>
            <li><b>Check for Breaks or Blistering: </b>Carefully examine the element for any breaks in the continuity of the coil or any blistering along the surface. These physical deformities are clear indicators that the element is defective.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If these tests indicate that the oven element is indeed bad, replacement is typically the best option. Replacing an oven element is a relatively straightforward DIY repair, or you can opt to hire a professional technician to ensure the job is done safely and correctly.</p>

Here are key indicators and considerations to help you decide whether to repair or replace your commercial oven, taking into account various oven types, including steam ovens and gas appliances:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Oven Temperature Inaccuracies: </b>If your oven is not maintaining the set temperature, it can lead to undercooked or overcooked food, which in severe cases might even risk food poisoning. Most ovens should cook food evenly and at a consistent temperature. If recalibration or basic DIY repairs like replacing the temperature sensor or thermostat don't fix the issue, it might be time to consider a new oven.</li>
            <li><b>High Oven Repair Costs: </b>When facing a costly repair, such as replacing the tempered glass of the oven door or significant components like the heating element or gas line, you should consider the oven repair cost against the price of a new oven. If the cost of the repair approaches or exceeds 50% of the average cost of a new comparable oven, replacement is often more economically sensible. The repair cost of stove repair can vary widely, but getting estimates can help in making this decision.</li>
            <li><b>Frequent Breakdowns: </b>If your oven frequently needs repairs, these costs can quickly add up. Most repairs might seem minor, but when they become recurrent, they not only increase downtime but also affect the efficiency of your cooking operations. It's worth fixing an oven if the repairs are infrequent and affordable, but consistent issues might indicate it's time to replace it.</li>
            <li><b>Availability of Replacement Parts:  </b>For older or discontinued oven models, finding the necessary replacement part can be challenging and sometimes more expensive than the part itself. If parts are particularly hard to find, this could significantly increase both the direct cost of the repair and the time your oven is out of service.</li>
            <li><b>Energy Efficiency and Performance: </b>Newer oven models are typically more energy-efficient and might come with advanced features that improve cooking quality and safety. If your current oven is a gas appliance and you're noticing inefficiencies or concerns with the gas line, upgrading to a newer model might also enhance safety and performance.</li>
            <li><b>Comparative Cost of New Ovens: </b>Research the cost of new ovens that would meet your needs. If your current oven is nearing the end of its expected lifespan (most commercial ovens last around 10-15 years, depending on maintenance and usage), investing in a new oven might be more cost-effective in the long run.</li>
            <li><b>Impact on Other Appliances: </b>Sometimes, an old or malfunctioning oven can place additional strain on other appliances in your kitchen. If this is the case, replacing it could help preserve the longevity and efficiency of your entire kitchen setup.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Deciding whether to fix or replace your commercial oven is a significant decision that impacts your kitchen's operational efficiency and the quality of food you serve. By considering these factors—especially the stove repair costs and oven repair costs versus the cost of a new oven—you can make an informed decision that best suits your business needs. Remember, a well-functioning oven is crucial to properly cook food and keep your operations running smoothly.</p>
          <p>When running a commercial kitchen, ensuring your oven functions correctly is crucial to your ability to cook high-quality meals. If you notice issues with cooking temperatures or uneven heating, it may be time to consider a stove repair. The decision to fix or replace a commercial oven depends heavily on the oven repair cost and the average cost of a new unit. Typically, if the cost to fix the oven approaches or exceeds 50% of the cost to replace it with a new model, it might be more economical to replace the oven. Regular maintenance can often extend the life of your oven, allowing you to cook effectively without frequent disruptions. However, when persistent problems arise, a timely fix can save you money and maintain the quality of food you cook for your customers. Remember, assessing both the oven repair cost and the average cost of replacement can guide your decision on whether to fix or replace your commercial oven.</p>
